# OSTIS Problem-Solver Library

This repository is a centralized storage for the components of problem-solver for ostis-systems. It contains the following components: 

- [Library of Common Utilities](#library-of-common-utilities);
- [Non-Atomic Action Interpreter Module](#non-atomic-action-interpreter-module)

## Library of Common Utilities

The Library of Common Utilities is a collection of reusable utility functions, classes, and templates that can be used across various components of the OSTIS system. This library provides common functionality and reduces code duplication.

For more information about the Library of Common Utilities, [refer to the README file in the `common` folder](https://github.com/ostis-ai/ostis-ps-lib/tree/main/common).

## Non-Atomic Action Interpreter Module

The Non-Atomic Action Interpreter Module is responsible for interpreting non-atomic actions within the OSTIS.

For more information about the Non-Atomic Action Interpreter Module, [refer to the README file in the `non-atomic-action-interpreter-module` folder](https://github.com/ostis-ai/ostis-ps-lib/tree/main/non-atomic-action-interpreter-module).
